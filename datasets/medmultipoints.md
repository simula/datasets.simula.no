The **MedMultiPoints** dataset is a curated **multimodal medical imaging benchmark** designed for **multi-task learning**—spanning **object detection**, **localization**, and **counting** tasks.  
It integrates data from both **endoscopic** (HyperKvasir) and **microscopic** (VISEM-Tracking) modalities to reflect real-world clinical diversity and imaging conditions.

It is introduced in the paper:  
**"Point, Detect, Count: Multi-Task Medical Image Understanding with Instruction-Tuned Vision-Language Models"**  
📍 *Presented at IEEE CBMS 2025, Madrid, Spain*

## 🧩 Dataset Summary

| Component | Details |
|------------|----------|
| **Images** | 10 600 endoscopic and microscopic medical images |
| **Tasks** | Object Detection • Point Localization • Object Counting |
| **Annotations** | Bounding boxes, point coordinates, count labels, and class labels |
| **Modalities** | Endoscopy (GI) and Microscopy |
| **Format** | JSONL instruction-style annotations for VLM and multi-task pipelines |
| **Intended Use** | Multi-task, instruction-based, and multimodal medical AI research |

---

## 📚 Features

- 🩻 **Multi-type annotations** per image:  
  - `bbox_2d`: Bounding boxes for detection  
  - `point_2d`: Points for localization  
  - `count`: Object counts  
- 🔗 Designed for **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)** and **instruction-tuned frameworks**  
- 🧠 Enables **cross-task supervision**—learning from counting, detection, and localization jointly
