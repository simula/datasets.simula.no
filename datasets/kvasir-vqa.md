<!-- # Kvasir-VQA: A Text-Image Pair GI Tract Dataset -->


The Kvasir-VQA dataset is an extended dataset derived from the HyperKvasir and Kvasir-Instrument datasets, augmented with question-and-answer annotations. This dataset is designed to facilitate advanced machine learning tasks in gastrointestinal (GI) diagnostics, including image captioning, Visual Question Answering (VQA) and text-based generation of synthetic medical images

## Dataset Details

### Image Categories

The dataset includes images from various GI tract conditions and medical instruments used in GI procedures:

| **Image Category**          | **Number of Samples** |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------|
| Normal Images               | 2500                  |
| HyperKvasir-Polyps          | 1000                  |
| HyperKvasir-Esophagitis     | 1000                  |
| HyperKvasir-Ulcerative Colitis | 1000               |
| Kvasir-Instrument           | 1000                  |
| **Total**                   | **6500**              |

### Annotation Process

Annotations were developed with input from medical professionals and include six types of questions:

- **Yes/No Questions**
- **Single-Choice Questions**
- **Multiple-Choice Questions**
- **Color-Related Questions**
- **Location-Related Questions**
- **Numerical Count Questions**

Annotations cover a range of GI aspects, including findings, abnormalities, anatomical landmarks, and medical instruments.
